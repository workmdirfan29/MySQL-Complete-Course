# âœ… Types of Database Queries in SQL (5 Types)

SQL queries are categorized into five main types based on their functionality:

## 1. DQL (Data Query Language)

Used to query and retrieve data from a database.

**Command:**

- `SELECT` â€“ Retrieves records from one or more tables.

## 2. DML (Data Manipulation Language)

Used to manipulate data within existing tables.

**Commands:**

- `INSERT` â€“ Adds new rows
- `UPDATE` â€“ Modifies existing rows
- `DELETE` â€“ Removes rows
- `MERGE` â€“ Combines insert and update in one statement (used in some SQL dialects)

## 3. DDL (Data Definition Language)

Used to define or alter the structure of the database objects.

**Commands:**

- `CREATE` â€“ Creates tables, views, databases, etc.
- `ALTER` â€“ Modifies existing objects
- `DROP` â€“ Deletes database objects
- `TRUNCATE` â€“ Removes all rows from a table quickly without logging each row deletion

## 4. DCL (Data Control Language)

Used to control access to data in the database.

**Commands:**

- `GRANT` â€“ Gives user access privileges
- `REVOKE` â€“ Removes access privileges

## 5. TCL (Transaction Control Language)

Used to manage transactions in a database.

**Commands:**

- `COMMIT` â€“ Saves all changes made by the transaction
- `ROLLBACK` â€“ Reverses the transaction
- `SAVEPOINT` â€“ Sets a point within a transaction for partial rollbacks
- `SET TRANSACTION` â€“ Sets properties for a transaction
